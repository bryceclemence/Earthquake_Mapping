# Earthquake_Mapping

### Overview
  The purpose of this analysis was to create a vizualization of the location of earthquakes and their magnitide in the past 7 days, along with the outlines of the Earth's tectonic plates.
 We used our knowledge of JavaScript, along with HTML and CSS to create a webpage displaying this information.


### Results
You can see the completed webpage below with each circle representing an earthquake and the blue lines representing the Earth's tectonic plates.


### Conclusion
From this visualization we can see that the majority of eathquakes occur along the borders of tectonics plates. This of course makes sense as earthquakes are mainly a reaction the friction caused by tectonic plates mov
