# Earthquake_Mapping

### Overview
  The purpose of this analysis was to create a webpage using the Mapbox API to visualize the locations of recent earthquakes and their magnitide in the past 7 days. Along with mapping recent earthquakes and their magnitude, we also included the borders to Earth's tectonic plates to see the correlation between where each tectonic plate was, and where earthquakes occured to most..
 We used our knowledge of JavaScript, along with HTML and CSS to create a webpage displaying this information.


### Results
You can see the completed webpage below with each circle representing an earthquake and the blue lines representing the Earth's tectonic plates.


### Conclusion
From this visualization we can see that the majority of eathquakes occur along the borders of tectonics plates. This of course makes sense as earthquakes are mainly a reaction the friction caused by tectonic plates mov
